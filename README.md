# c_46_linear_search_string

## DESCRIPTION

A linear search is the simplest approach employed to search for an element in a data set. It examines each element until it finds a match, starting at the beginning of the data set, until the end. The search is finished and terminated once the target element is located.

To compare strings I have to use a function called [`strcmp(str1, str2)`](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strcmp.htm) from `string.h` library.
